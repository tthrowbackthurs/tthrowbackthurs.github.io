              </h3>
            </a>
            <p>We've all heard that data is the future, but it's easy to forget how much data is out there about our past, and the lessons that can be learned from it. Taking inspiration from other community projects like Makeover Monday and Workout Wednesday, Throwback Thursday is an exploration history through a contemporary data visualization lens. </p>

            <p>Every Thursday, we'll post a historical dataset we've found interseting. Gold rush migrations, home prices from the 1930s... anything that catches our eye. Along with that datset, we'll provide a visualization of it, along with our thoughts and findings as we explore it.</p>

            <p>If you would like to participate, just tweet your creations with the hashtag #ThrowbackThursday and tagging @TThrowbackThurs. On Monday, we'll highlight some of your submissions and feature them on the site.</p>
