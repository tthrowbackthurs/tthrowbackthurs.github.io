      <h2 class="section-heading">Historical Background</h2>
        <p>On the 12th of this Month, the Walt Disney Company is releasing their newest offering, Disney+.  While typically the innovator, this move is reactive as a response to the changing demand of the consumer.  While the idea of a streaming platform is not innovative, Disney’s hope is that their programming will set them apart and be another money making machine.</p>
        <p>Over Disney’s history, their capacity to make money has only been limited by the imaginations of the creative people that work for the company.  Almost everything Walt Disney touched turned to gold.  Disney has always set the standards and in doing so, has been able to create a loyal consumer following that continues to fund and drive their next innovation.  </p>
        <p>Over time, the company diversified from their initial work in animated shorts and feature length films, turning first to consumer products, then producing content for television, their first foray into theme parks with Disneyland and the eventual expansion of all of these, they have always been looking for the next big revenue generator.  This week, we’re looking at Disney’s revenue, broken down by quarter and revenue stream.  The four major revenue streams (business segments) we have data for are Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive Media.  A quick descriptor of each is included below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Media Networks – Disney’s media networks are broken down into two sub-categories: Cable Networks (ESPN, Disney Channel and ABC Family), and Broadcasting (ABC).  Revenue from this stream is driven by contracts for its affiliates, advertising, licensing fees (for series broadcast on other networks) and more.  Significant revenue can be generated for major sporting events – Super Bowl or College Football Bowl Games.</li>
            <li>Parks and Resorts – It is not a secret that Disney owns significant property in this category.  From the sprawling Disney World to Disneyland (including Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong & Shanghai) to non-theme park resorts – Aulani, Disney’s Hilton Head Island Resort and others.  Revenue here is generated through hotel fees, entrance fees, merchandising and special experiences among others.</li>
            <li>Studio Entertainment – When you think Disney, if the first thing that pops in your head is not Disney World, it’s likely that you think of movies.  Walt Disney Studios has several subsidiaries, including Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios and more.  Revenue here is driven by box office sales, licensing, home distribution and streaming.</li>
            <li>Consumer Products & Interactive Media (known currently as Consumer Products) – Take a walk down the toy aisle of your nearest big box retailer and it’s immediately clear where Disney makes its money on this one.  Beyond the sale of toys, clothing and more, Disney also rolls interactive media into this category.  Interactive Media incorporates software subsidiaries, Disney’s web presence and Disney games (the Infinity series and mobile games).</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Note that Disney began reporting its revenue by different business segments in FY2019, so we’ll not include those in this data set.</p>
        <p>We'd really love to see what you can do with this month's dataset!  Download the data and see what you can visualize.  Create your viz and post your work to Tableau Public and Twitter with the hashtag #ThrowbackDataThursday, tagging <a href="https://twitter.com/TThrowbackThurs" target="_blank">@TThrowbackThurs</a>.  We'll feature community vizzes throughout the month!</p>
